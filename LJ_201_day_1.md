#LJ Code 201 - Day 1

I learned a lot in applying the pre-work we did to more tangible tasks, especially with navigating in the terminal and using git. Conceptually, this started to come together more cohesively with additional review, and although we didn't really get to group work, I'm hoping to continue seeing how others' solutions, challenges, questions, etc. might contrast or parallel my own.

I'm also looking forward to diving deeper into JavaScript after the pre-work; Codecademy was helpful since I'm completely new to the language, but obviously it will be even more so to cover concepts in a collaborative learning setting with more tailored guidance.
