#LJ Code 201 - Day 10

For the pair programming lab, it was helpful that Tyler and I first made a layout of the general HTML elements we would need for our page and wrote out the code for that first to get structure down. We then worked through section by section to style and position with CSS. Use of the browser console to experiment with CSS changes first really helped to make our process more efficient (something I learned from Tyler and implemented in restructuring my CSS for the Salmon Cookies project). I feel like we did well with time management and choosing our battles with styling, and that made it an overall positive experience. The fact that it went smoothly was especially a breath of fresh air for me after a rough week of trying to catch up on the Salmon Cookies project.

Over the weekend, I did some catching up on adding discussion postings for past readings and restyled CSS for the Salmon Cookies page, but still working through a lot of catch up. I feel much better about consolidation of conceptual understanding of the week's material than I did at the beginning of the week.
