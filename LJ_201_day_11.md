#LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Strategizing how to get back on track with extra support at home - my boyfriend has worked a lot with Java and wants to learn JS, so we're trying a split sleep schedule to add some extra time for learning. I'm going to try to review concepts from the past few weeks again in a different format, such as other video tutorials, to better consolidate the ones I can't seem to mechanically implement.

As far as the lab from yesterday is concerned, I let my frustration get in the way of getting anywhere, which is another aspect of this learning process that I need to create some coping mechanisms for.
