#LJ Code 201 - Day 12

Got a lot of perspective today and felt better about my progress after checking in with Aaron at the end of lab. I was having a really hard time managing negative feelings surrounding my delayed processing of some concepts, which has definitely had an effect on my ability to keep up with completing lab assignments. As mentioned in yesterday's journal, I'm hoping that adding to my learning routine at home will help maintain positive learning space as I continue to work towards catching up before next week. Getting there with split sleep!

I'd also like to collaborate a bit more with others in the class, especially if they are experiencing similar paths in their learning, and it sounds like that is an instructor goal as well.
