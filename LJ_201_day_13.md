#LJ Code 201 - Day 13

Got closer with populating the chart with data, but couldn't get it to work yet. Feeling better about being less behind than last week, and grateful that we will have Monday off to catch up before the final week.

Arranged for a review session with other classmates after Day 14's class, which should be beneficial before submitting the Code 301 entrance exam.
