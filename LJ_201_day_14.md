#LJ Code 201 - Day 14

I'm glad we got to see a bit of introduction to 301 material today, and feel that my group did a nice job of planning and preparing for our first official day of scaffolding the project.

We wrapped up planning about an hour before lab ended and decided to start reviewing concepts and code as a larger class group, which I found helpful and appeared to be beneficial for others as well. Looking forward to implementing our ideas by using what we've learned throughout the course, and hopefully also build something that could potentially be expanded upon.
