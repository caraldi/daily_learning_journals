#LJ Code 201 - Day 17

Felt a bit stressed about getting everything working for our app by Friday, but do feel that we got a lot done in one day today. Regularly updating our goals has been helpful, and reworking approaching a few of the functional features has been a great review of JS for me. I like the type of creative thinking and problem solving involved in building an app.

Specifics were really noted in the report assignments, which I have appreciated as another way to track our progress.
