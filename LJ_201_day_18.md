#LJ Code 201 - Day 18

Individually, I worked quite a bit on styling the results page and my own education category page, as well as filling out the JS on the latter. I also assisted Tyler in thinking through a list rating feature. We ended the day with a few bugs to work out, and a lot of ambiguity as to how each page will look. We had initially pushed for creating a wireframe to avoid problems with styling, but this was not taken up by the group as a whole and therefore it was hard to be on the same page.

I struggled a lot with being frustrated that things like the wireframe that I had really wanted worked through early on in the planning phase were an issue this late in the project. There were a lot of questions that came up, for which much of the information had already been clearly laid out in our Slack channel and commit notes, so lack of group cohesion I again found challenging.

Attended the first part of the tech crawl, which made me excited about future job opportunities and gave me a better idea of what Portland startup culture is like.
