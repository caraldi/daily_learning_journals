# LJ Code 201 - Day 2
I really enjoyed trying to tie together what I've learned so far about HTML and CSS in today's lab work. CSS styling is super interesting to me, although I find it overwhelming as a beginner wanting to do a lot more than my current skill level allows (really had a good giggle about the Peter Griffin gif!). I did appreciate Google in navigating this challenge - it allowed me to do a bit more styling than I might have done otherwise - although I did try to keep it simple so as not to drive myself completely crazy.

I used a switch in my JavaScript, which I found to be simpler than attempting an if/else loop for the five questions. This was a good review of the code syntax for me and it was a boost to be able to get to a solution that worked for me.

Lastly, I felt more comfortable with branches than expected, which was nice!
