# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Today, I got a bit bogged down in the for/while loops of the lab assignment. When trying to code my sixth question (guess the number), I thought I had made the mistake of creating an infinite loop, but the problem turned out to be that it was running the entire script four times, instead of only taking four guesses. I got somewhat overwhelmed by how much was going on in that section and ran out of time, so I ended up having to finish the assignment at home. Before getting to that point, I took some time removing the switch I had coded into my about_me page yesterday and replaced it with an if/else statement, and that proved to be pretty simple.

I found it helpful to sketch out some of what I would be coding before actually making the attempt in my text editor (planning questions/alerts, laying out which statements would go where), and once again, Stack Overflow and TA assistance were super helpful!

I'm feeling pretty confident conceptually with what we have covered so far, but definitely feel I need more practice with loops.
