# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Chris was super helpful and patient with me during lab, and we worked through my last two questions to fix my incomplete code. The errors I was running into on question six were incorrect placement of variables in relation to the loop and use of unnecessary if/else statements (just needed else as last, since it was the only possibility left). On question seven, I wasn't using .indexof properly.

I felt extremely frustrated and behind all day, but breaking through was such a huge relief, and we were able to achieve smooth sailing through the rest of the partnered work. This left me a little time to add an ordered list to my HTML from yesterday and make sure I had everything I needed to resubmit and be caught up.

Whew!
