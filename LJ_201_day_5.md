# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

I had a bit of trouble with the third function lab problem because I was not indexing correctly when declaring my variable:

var productTotal = multiply((multiply(a, b)[0]), c)[0];

Once I figured that out (with some help!), the others made greater sense conceptually.

Over the weekend, reviewing the readings and working some on my html/css in the about_me page was helpful.
