# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

I found this assignment really challenging, and the first time that conceptually I had a hard time following everything in class. Objects and the DOM loosely make sense overall, but writing the code was really difficult for me.

I did enjoy the HTML/CSS side of creating the site, but ultimately could not figure out how to get the cookie sales numbers to display properly in my link to sales.html.

Tim worked with me through a lot of the general structure I ended up with, but it still has a long way to go!
