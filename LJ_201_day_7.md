# LJ Code 201 - Day 7

Once again, JavaScript challenged me - I had more catching up to do with the hours rendering function from the sixth day's lab assignment, but once I had that running properly, rendering the table was difficult. I find it really helpful to whiteboard how everything is laid out in the DOM, but it was really challenging for me to look at the code and follow where things were being appended.

After not finishing the table at the end of lab, I went home to try to explain it to someone else in the hope that it would consolidate my understanding a bit more. That strategy worked to some degree, but I'm still a bit lost on executing that portion in code. Falling into a pattern of playing catch-up this week is somewhat discouraging, but code review at home and multiple pass-throughs of the readings is keeping me conceptually afloat - I think.

I worry mostly that I won't be able to articulate what I do understand, which is a general thing for me in all learning - my processing style is heavily reflective and therefore pretty slow. On the plus side, I've been consistently having fun messing with the CSS side of the assignment!
