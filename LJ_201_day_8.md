# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

I'm feeling pretty behind on lab work, as I was still working through the constructor assignment yesterday afternoon. I got through the rendering piece, which had issues because I changed the way I was accessing the hours of operation from a function to an array. From there, no table is rendering and therefore getting a form together wasn't yet possible.

I was able to fill in some gaps in my understanding of the DOM and creating objects using constructors, and had no trouble following the lecture on forms. I feel caught up in my understanding/conceptual grasp, but execution of the code is still proving problematic.

I need to get a better routine figured out so that I can catch up more at home - I've been coming in to class early for the past few days, and that has helped orient me before new lecture starts.
