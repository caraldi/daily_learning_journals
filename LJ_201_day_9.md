# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

It was a huge relief to have a day of js review and lab catch up, although I still had trouble rendering my table. I was able to get to the point of rendering a table with each store name, but times were displayed as headlines for each as well. I created a separate function for creating the table and used the render method on the store prototype to create the rows of data. Logging each showed that the numbers were there, but not as a table - hopefully it's getting close!

Going back through the code and mapping where things were being appended was helpful, and using comments and console.log should help finally debug.
